## Description
      
A simple CLI app that produces an SVG logo based on user prompt inputs.  This project was used as an excercise to practice using classes, inheritance, and modulation.  This was also the first time I've utilized tests on a program.  I'm still coming to grips with the testing process and it's uses, but it was nice to get the opportunity to work with them, and I really like making the tests go green :) 

## Installation
  
type `npm install` into the console once the project is opened up in VSCODE.  

## Usage
  
type `node index.js` into the console and answer the prompts.
